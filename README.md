### Data collected
- Email
- Name
- Photo ratings

Your email is used to sign in to the app.
Your name is currently not used for anything within the app, but might be used to refer to you if you contact support about an issue.
Ratings for photos you submit within the app will be used to improve the machine learning model to be integrated into our photo library service.
None of the above information will ever be sold or shared with a third party.

### Photos
Lensii is a two-part service.
One of these parts is a photo sharing social space in which you can make posts.

Anything you post on Lensii is publically viewable by anyone through the app.
We will not sell or share any photos you publically post to Lensii to any third party.

The second part is a photo library, meant to help you figure out which of your many photos look good.
Photos that you upload to your library are **NOT** publically viewable by anyone but yourself and those you explicitly share those photos with.
Note that as of November 4, 2021, this second part is still in development.
